Dr.Chokkalingam:

Hi

Should we need to call Dr.Karthikeyan regarding this chart to be discussed?

Dr.Jayabalan:

yes please could you call Dr. Karthikeyan

i think we should retrieve some journals regarding oral health prevalence among Asian countries

Dr.Chokkalingam:

yep, we should not stop with Asian countries alone, we should also look for Oceania region for further research

don't stop with this, look for other books in internet for oral diseases prevalence world wide

Dr.Jayabalan:

check for any other documentaries on oral health in Netflix

Dr.Chokkalingam:

OK, i will keep things ready by next tuesday

also,  i heard Dr.George Bennett's book on Oral diseases and management as good starter for understanding this data

we should read that have a fair share of our understanding before detailedly discussing this dataset

Dr.Jayabalan:

Ok i will look into it. and i should also look for top 10 books on  oral health prevalence in google

Dr.Chokkalingam:

dont just lookin google alone, also try Chatgpt

Make sure have a premium version of chatgpt, i heard the results in the chatgpt premium version are awesome

Dr.Jayabalan:

no worries i already have the premium version of chatgpt

Dr.Chokkalingam:

Ok. Google lists the following books: Oral Epidemiology: A Textbook on Oral Health Conditions, Research Topics and Methods (Textbooks in Contemporary Dentistry) Hardcover â€“ 20 October 2020. I find it a good read , i will order this book in amazon
